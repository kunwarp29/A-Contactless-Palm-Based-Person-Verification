# A-Contactless-Palm-Based-Person-Verification-Using-Deep-Learning
Due to Covid19, a person is advised not to touch any surface and hygiene issue is also there. So in this scenario, a contactless palmprint verification will play a vital role. 
a) Developing a contactless palm based person verification model using Convolutional Neural Networks.
b) Implemented Inception Resnet V2 model for the large scale image recognition when training the model.
c) Implemented the feature extraction using Convolutional Layer so that training time can be efficient.
d) Used IIT Delhi touchless palmprint database for the dataset purpose.
